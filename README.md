# Toronto-Airbnb-Pricing-Analysis
Airbnb’s business model has changed the traditional hospitality industry as its popularity grew among travelers. Since it was launched in 2008, Airbnb has experienced exponential growth, increasing the number of listings around the world.

In Canada, Toronto is the leading tourism destination receiving every year 27.5 million visitors (Tourism, Toronto, 2018). That implies that Toronto is one of the target markets for Airbnb. Thus, pricing a rental property on Airbnb presents a challenge to hosts because it depends on the property type, the location, amenities, between others. Also, it considers the demand for property throughout the year. As an internet marketplace for short-term home and apartment rentals, the amount a host can charge for a night depends on the dynamics of the marketplace. 

Thus, this project aims to build and evaluate machine learning tree-based-models, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, to predict the nightly rent price of the property given the minimal information about the listing and the customers’ reviews.
